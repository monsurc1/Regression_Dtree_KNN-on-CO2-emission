Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sindhuinti/co2-emission 

This set of data shows the details of the CO2 emissions by vehicles(cars) in Canada over a period of 7 years and originated from open.canada.ca/ website link.
It seems that CO2 emissions can vary with the different features.

As CO2 emission is one of the major environmental pollution issues in todayâ€™s world, I tried to explore the relationship of the features against the emission.

Multiple linear regression models are performed on this dataset.
