# Regression_Dtree_KNN-on-CO2-emission

## **Regression Analysis**
### **1.1 Business Understanding**
	Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sindhuinti/co2-emission 
	
	This set of data shows the details of the CO2 emissions by vehicles(cars) in Canada over a period of 7 years and originated from 
 	[open.canada.ca] website link.
	It seems that CO2 emissions can vary with the different features.
	
	As CO2 emission is one of the major environmental pollution issues in today’s world, I tried to explore the relationship between the features 
 	against the emission.
	
	Multiple linear regression models are performed on this dataset.

### **1.2 Data Understanding & Preparation**
	There are a total of 7385 rows and 12 columns. There are a few abbreviations that have been used to describe the features. I am listing them out here. 
 	The same can be found in the Data Description sheet.
	
 	Dataset attributes:
		• Car Make
		• Car Model
		• Vehicle(car) Class
		• Engine Size(L)
		• No. of. Cylinders
		• Transmission Type
		• Fuel Type ( X = Regular gasoline, Z = Premium gasoline, D = Diesel, E = Ethanol, N = Natural gas)
		• Fuel Consumption City (L/100 km)
		• Fuel Consumption Hwy (L/100 km) – (on Highway)
		• Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km) - (combined fuel consumption)
		• Fuel Consumption Comb (mpg) – (in mile per gallon)
  		• CO2 Emissions(g/km) – (in grams per kilometre)
